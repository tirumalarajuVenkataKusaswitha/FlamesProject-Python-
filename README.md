# FlamesProject-Python-
The FLAMES game is a fun and popular game that tells you the relationship between two people based on their names. Using a simple set of rules, the program predicts if two people are Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Married, Enemies, or Siblings. This project uses Python to play the FLAMES game automatically!
